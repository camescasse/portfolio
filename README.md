# camescasse.dev: Portfolio

Welcome to my personal website repository! This is a simple static site built with HTML and CSS, featuring a personal blog.

This website serves as my online portfolio and blog. You can find information about my projects, interests, and thoughts on various topics.

It is currently hosted on a VPS to free myself from the shackles of serverless deployment.
