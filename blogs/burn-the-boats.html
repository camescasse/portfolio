        I have always had trouble committing to decisions that, by their nature,
        close off other opportunities. This applies to both my personal and
        professional life. The biggest challenge I’ve encountered in my efforts
        to enter the development field has been figuring out which path I want
        to pursue and how much I’m willing to commit to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that committing, for example, to generative AI and machine
        learning doesn’t necessarily stop you from eventually learning or
        pivoting toward, say, low-level C, Rust, or Zig. However, it certainly
        consumes a significant amount of time and bandwidth to dive deeply
        enough to gain meaningful knowledge. That effort will be hindered
        considerably if it’s spread thin across multiple areas of focus.

        Although the phrase in this post’s title has become somewhat cliché, it
        still resonates deeply with me. I’ve always struggled with making major
        commitments (What country should I live in? What degree should I pursue?
        What breed of dog should I get?). I think this resonates with me because
        constantly keeping it in the back of my mind helps me remember that if I
        never commit to something, I’ll never accomplish anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commit to doing fulfilling work. Commit to relationships that bring out
        the best in you. Commit to getting in the best shape of your life.
        Commit to improving yourself on something every single day.
